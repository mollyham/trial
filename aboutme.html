                    <h2>Hi, I am Sandy</h2>
                    <p>
                 I have been fascinated by Human Rights from a young age.
                  The ability to work with others in the quest for a better just world is one of the most useful and essential skills one can develop in school and college. 
                  I also believe that Human Rights are at the core of humanity. 
                  The notion that man is born free and deserves to live in a free world moves me miles.
                 Any unjust move against humanity in whichever form it manifests is ungodly.
                 I always strive to improve my skills and develop innovative and more effective strategies on how to better the world.
